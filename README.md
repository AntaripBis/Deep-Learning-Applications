# Deep-Learning-Applications
The repository contains different applications of deep learning using the keras and Tensorflow framework. The models have been developed in python. There are 3 applications at present - Speech to Text translation using Recurrent Neural Networks, Video Action Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks.

# System Requirements
1. 64-bit Intel or AMD machines
2. At least  8 GB RAM. Neural networks are require memory-intensive computing so 4 GB RAM may not be sufficient or may require certain memory management.
3. Preferably Linux operating system - Ubuntu or Redhat. Windows can be used for deploying Tensorflow but certain libraries used in the analyses may not work properly.
4. GPU (optional) may be used to speed up computation.

# Libraries
1. Tensorflow
2. Keras
3. Librosa
4. OpenCV
